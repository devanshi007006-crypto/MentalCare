            <h2>The Power of Small Steps 🌱</h2>
            <p>
                Healing and growth are rarely linear journeys. Don't underestimate the impact of small, consistent actions taken every day.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Celebrate Micro-Wins:</b> Acknowledge small successes, like getting out of bed or drinking a glass of water. Every effort matters.</li>
                <li><b>Practice Non-Judgment:</b> Treat yourself with the same kindness and patience you would offer a struggling friend.</li>
                <li><b>Focus on the Present:</b> When the future feels overwhelming, anchor yourself in what you can do in this moment.</li>

            <h2>Remember Your Value ❤️</h2>
            <p>
                Your worth is inherent and does not depend on your productivity, mood, or current challenges.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>You Are Not Your Thoughts:</b> Difficult feelings are temporary states, not definitions of who you are.</li>
                <li><b>You Are Resilient:</b> You have overcome challenges before, and you possess the inner strength to navigate this one too.</li>
                <li><b>Help is a Strength:</b> Seeking support is a sign of courage and self-awareness, not weakness.</li>

            <h2>When to seek help</h2>
            <p>
                Consider talking to a doctor, counselor, or mental health professional if low mood, anxiety, or stress
                are affecting your daily life for more than a few weeks, or if you feel unsafe with your thoughts.
